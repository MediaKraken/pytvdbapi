    :raise: :exc:`pytvdbapi.error.TVDBIndexError`

    Holds all the episodes that belong to a specific season. It is possible
    to iterate over the Season to obtain the individual :class:`Episode`
    instances. It is also possible to obtain an individual episode using the
    [ ] syntax. It will raise :class:`pytvdbapi.error.TVDBIndexError` if trying
    to index an invalid episode index.

    It is possible to obtain the containing :class:`Show` instance through the
    *Season.show* attribute.

    Example::

        >>> from pytvdbapi import api
        >>> db = api.TVDB("B43FF87DE395DF56")
        >>> result = db.search("Dexter", "en")
        >>> show = result[0]

        >>> season = show[2]
        >>> len(season)  # Number of episodes in the season
        12

        >>> print(season.season_number)
        2

        >>> print(season[2].EpisodeName)
        Waiting to Exhale

        >>> for episode in season: #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        ...     print(episode.EpisodeName)
